# apply

The `git apply` command is used to apply patch files to a Git repository. These patches are typically created using the `git diff` command and represent changes between different sets of files or commits. Below is a detailed explanation of the `git apply` command, its frequently used options, and examples of its application.

### Basic Explanation

The `git apply` command reads a patch file and applies the changes it contains to the files in your working directory. This command does not create a commit; it simply updates the files with the changes specified in the patch.

### Commonly Used Options

* **`--check`**: Checks if the patch can be applied cleanly without actually applying it. This is useful for verifying patches before making changes.
* **`--stat`**: Displays a summary of changes that would be made by the patch, including the number of lines added or removed.
* **`--whitespace=<option>`**: Controls how whitespace errors are handled. Options include `fix`, which automatically corrects whitespace errors, and `warn`, which displays warnings but applies the patch as-is.
* **`--reverse`**: Reverses the changes specified in the patch, effectively undoing them.
* **`--index`**: Applies the patch to both the working directory and the index (staging area).

### Example Usage

#### Applying a Patch

To apply a patch named `changes.patch`, use:

```bash
git apply changes.patch
```

This will modify your working directory with the changes specified in `changes.patch`.

#### Checking a Patch Before Applying

Before applying a patch, you can check if it will apply cleanly:

```bash
git apply --check changes.patch
```

If there are no errors, this command will produce no output, indicating that the patch can be applied without issues.

#### Applying with Whitespace Fixes

To apply a patch while fixing any trailing whitespace issues, use:

```bash
git apply --whitespace=fix changes.patch
```

This command will remove any trailing whitespace as it applies the patch.

#### Viewing Patch Statistics

To see a summary of what changes will be made by a patch:

```bash
git apply --stat changes.patch
```

This provides an overview of how many lines will be added or removed by the patch.

#### Reversing a Patch

If you need to undo changes made by a previously applied patch:

```bash
git apply --reverse changes.patch
```

This reverses all modifications introduced by `changes.patch`.

These examples illustrate how `git apply` can be used to manage patches effectively within a Git workflow. By understanding these options and examples, you can better integrate patches into your development process.
