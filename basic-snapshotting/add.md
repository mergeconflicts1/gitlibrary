### Git Add Command Overview

The `git add` command is used to stage changes in your working directory for the next commit. By using this command, you can prepare your changes to be recorded in the Git repository.

#### Commonly Used Options

* `git add .`: Stages all changes in the current directory.
* `git add <file>`: Stages a specific file.
* `git add -p`: Allows for an interactive selection of the changes to stage.

#### Example Usage

```bash
# Stage all changes in the directory
git add .

# Stage a specific file
git add README.md

# Interactively stage patches of changes
git add -p
```

Use these options and examples to efficiently manage your changes in Git.
